# Classic Snake Game in Java


## Overview
The Classic Snake Game in Java is a simple yet nostalgic recreation of the iconic Snake game. Written in Java with the Swing library, this project demonstrates fundamental principles of game development, object-oriented programming, and graphical user interface (GUI) design.

## Features

- **Snake Movement:** Control the snake's direction using arrow keys (left, right, up, down).
- **Apple Generation:** Randomly generated apples appear for the snake to collect and grow.
- **Collision Detection:** The game checks for collisions with the snake's own body and screen boundaries.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your score as you collect apples.
- **Game Over Screen:** When the game ends, see your final score and the game over message.
